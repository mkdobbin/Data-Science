This repository contains course work and projects completed during my Masters degree at Northwestern University. Key projects are listed below.

## Northwestern/Machine Learning/Predicting Credit Default/
Capstone Project: Predicting the probability of default payments for credit card clients. Report details exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and predictive modelling. Implemented and compared results of different models including gradient boosted, logistic regression and support vector machine. Coding in R. 

## Northwestern/Deep Learning/CNN Bee Classifier/
Convolutional Neural Network project based on DrivenData.org competition 'Naive Bees Classifier'. The goal of the competition was to predict the species of bees from images. Using Python, four different convolutional neural network models were trialed and an AWS Deep Learning GPU instance (Ubuntu p2.xlarge) was used to meet the computational requirements.
