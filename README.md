## Northwestern/Machine Learning/Predicting Credit Default/
Capstone Project.

## Northwestern/Deep Learning/CNN Bee Classifier/
Convolutional Neural Network project based on DrivenData.org competition 'Naive Bees Classifier'. The goal of the competition was to predict the species of bees from images. Using Python, four different convolutional neural network models were trialed and an AWS Deep Learning GPU instance (Ubuntu p2.xlarge) was used to meet the computational requirements.
